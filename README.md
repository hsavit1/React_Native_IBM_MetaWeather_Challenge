React Native solution to the MetaWeather Challenge

This repo contains a React Native solution to the MetaWeather challenge. I had done a [Swift solution](https://github.com/hsavit1/IBM_MetaWeather_Challenge) as well using a Redux flavored library called ReSwift, but I thought that the code did not come out as clean as I would have liked and I was rather unhappy with the final product. So I created this project to show how a well crafted Redux architecture can really clean up your code design.

In this project I took advantage of a helpful tools

- create-react-native-app
- Redux
- Redux-Thunk middleware
- Redux-Persist 
- Styled Components
- React Native Elements
- Reactotron

I was surprised at how quickly that I was able to fly through this, compared to the Swift equivalent. The Redux ecosystem that you have available to you as a Javascript developer seems to be far ahead of the ReSwift ecosystem in terms of available plugins, middlewares, and debugging tools. That combined with hot reloading allowed me to complete this in a fraction of the time that it took for me to do it in Swift (and I consider myself to be a much more fluent with Swift than I am with Javascript! ) And it runs on Android as well.
